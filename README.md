# ComputerCraft Minecraft

Collection of lua scripts for computercraft mod.
See http://www.computercraft.info/

# Install

Setting the whole project as root: this only works for singleplayer.
Installs all scripts accessible to all turtles under the /rom directory.

#### Minecraft 1.12

Checkout the entire project in the `/resourcepacks` folder in minecraft, or download as zip and unzip there.
For example, I put the `DeosjrComputerCraft` folder in 
`..\Minecraft\Instances\FTB Ultimate Reloaded\resourcepacks`
Since I now support 1.16 by default, rename the `data` folder to `assets`.

#### Minecraft 1.16

After version 1.12 scripts can no longer be loaded as resourcepacks for all worlds.
Instead, install them as datapacks for a single world (all worlds possible with global datapack mod)
Find the save folder for the world you want to install for, go to the `/datapacks` folder.
Checkout the project there, and reload the world.
